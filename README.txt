This application gathers the list of the urls from each of the urls provided and further parses
the html and saves the html in he current folder and the extracted urls to the seperate table.
It stores the original urls entered by the user to parse in one table
and in the other table it stores the found urls after parsing html.
Any duplicate or existing urls will be ignored, only the non duplicate ones will be entered
into the table.

Note: Please download BeautifulSoup4 library to use bs4 packages, you may install it in the drive where you
are running this application or you can install it in your pc using 'pip install beautifulsoup4'
